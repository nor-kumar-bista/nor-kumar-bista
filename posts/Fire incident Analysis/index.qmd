This case study was prepared by my team for the **Business Analytics** Course for the *'Winter 2025 Term'.*

Leveraging **City of Toronto (2023)** datasets, we apply BI and data analysis for a Safety & Fire Equipment firm (alarms, sprinklers, detectors, firefighter gear).\
Findings inform recommendations to boost product profitability and market reach.
